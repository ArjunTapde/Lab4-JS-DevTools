1) Since `i` was initialized using `var`, this means that `i` does not have block scope. As a result, even though `i` is initalized within the for loop, it can still be accessed outside of that for loop in the function (function-scope). So, the value of `i` will be printed at Line 11, which is representative of the length of `prices` - 1.
2) Since `discountedPrice` was initalized using `var` within the for loop, this means that `discountedPrice` does not have block scope. As a result, `discountedPrice` can be accessed outside of the for loop within the function. As a result, Line 12 will print the discounted price of the last price element in the `prices` parameter. This value is equal to prices[prices.length - 1] * (1 - discount).
