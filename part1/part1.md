1) Since `i` was initialized using `var`, this means that `i` does not have block scope. As a result, even though `i` is initalized within the for loop, it can still be accessed outside of that for loop in the function (function-scope). So, the value of `i` will be printed at Line 11, which is representative of the length of `prices` - 1.
2) Since `discountedPrice` was initalized using `var` within the for loop, this means that `discountedPrice` does not have block scope. As a result, `discountedPrice` can be accessed outside of the for loop within the function. As a result, Line 12 will print the discounted price of the last price element in the `prices` parameter. This value is equal to prices[prices.length - 1] * (1 - discount).
3) Since `finalPrice` is within the scope of Line 13, as they are both under the function `discountPrices`, it's value is able to be printed at Line 13. This value will take the same value as that printed by Line 12, however it will be rounded to the nearest 2 decimal places (i.e. 12.75).
4) If we call `discountPrices([100, 200, 300], .5)`, the function will return the array `discounted` whose value is `[50, 100, 150]`. To explain, the fucntion will traverse through the parameter `prices` array and within the for loop, it will take every element in `prices` and calculate the discounted price and round that discounted price to 2 decimal places. Then, these calculated discounted prices are pushed into a `discounted` array, which will then be returned by the function. Thus, giving us `[50, 100, 150]` for the call `discountPrices([100, 200, 300], .5)`.
